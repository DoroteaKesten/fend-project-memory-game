## How to play

If you want to try out this game, download it and unzip. Open index.html file in your browser and enjoy.

There are eight pairs of cards that a player has to match. By clicking on a card, it reveals itself. A player can only open two cards at the time. Opened cards are then evaluated if they match. The goal is to find all matching pairs in the shortest time possible and with as few moves as possible.
